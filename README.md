# OLD STUFF
# AWIPS EDEX Server Docker Container

This repository contains files necessary to build and run a [Unidata AWIPS EDEX Data Server](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/awips2/) inside a Docker container.

## Quick Start

Download and install Docker and Docker Compose:

* [Docker for CentOS 7 Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/)
* [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
* [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (it should be bundled with Docker by default on Mac and Windows)

Clone this repository

    git clone https://github.com/Unidata/edex-docker.git
    cd edex-docker

Run the container with docker-compose

    docker-compose up -d edex-ingest

Confirm the container is running

    docker ps -a 

Enter the container

    docker exec -it edex-ingest bash    

Stop the container

    docker-compose stop

Delete the container (keep the image)

    docker-compose rm -f
    
Run commands inside the container, such as

    docker exec edex-ingest edex

which should return something like

    [edex status]
     qpid        :: running :: pid 22474
     EDEXingest  :: running :: pid 21860 31513
     EDEXgrib    :: not running
     ldmadmin    :: running :: pid 22483

     edex (status|start|stop|setup|log|purge|qpid|users)

To update to the latest version and restart:

```bash
docker pull unidata/edex-ingest:latest
docker-compose stop
docker-compose up -d edex-ingest
```

## Configuration and Customization

The file `docker-compose.yml` defines files to mount to the container and which ports to open:

    edex-ingest:
      image: unidata/edex-ingest:latest
      container_name: edex-ingest
      volumes:
        - ./etc/ldmd.conf:/awips2/ldm/etc/ldmd.conf
        - ./etc/pqact.conf:/awips2/ldm/etc/pqact.conf
        - ./bin/setup.env:/awips2/edex/bin/setup.env
        - ./bin/runedex.sh:/awips2/edex/bin/runedex.sh
      ports:
        - "388:388"
      ulimits:
        nofile:
          soft: 1024
          hard: 1024

## Mounted Files

- `etc/ldmd.conf`

    Defines which data feeds to receive. By default there is only one active request line (`REQUEST IDS|DDPLUS ".*" idd.unidata.ucar.edu`) to not overwhelm small EDEX containers ingesting large volumes of radar and gridded data files.  Any updates to the file `etc/ldmd.conf` will be read the next time you restart the container.
 
- `etc/pqact.conf`

    Defines how products are processed and where they are written to on the filesystem. This is the full set of pattern actions used in Unidata AWIPS, and generally you do not need to edit this file. Instead control which data feeds are requested in `ldmd.conf` (above).

- `bin/setup.env`

    Defines the remote EDEX Database/Request server:
    
        ### EDEX localization related variables ###
        export AW_SITE_IDENTIFIER=OAX
        export EXT_ADDR=js-157-198.jetstream-cloud.org

    **EXT_ADDR** must be set to an allowed EDEX Database/Request Server. In this example we are using a JetStream Cloud instance, which controls our edex-ingest access with IPtables, SSL certificates, and PostgreSQL pg_hba.conf rules (this server is used in software training workshop environments and will not allow outside connections). 

- `bin/runedex.sh`

    The default script run when the container is started, acts as a sort-of service manager for EDEX and the LDM (see `ENTRYPOINT ["/awips2/edex/bin/runedex.sh"]` in *Dockerfile.edex*), essentially:

        /awips2/qpid/bin/qpid-wrapper &
        /awips2/edex/bin/start.sh -noConsole ingest &
        ldmadmin mkqueue
        ldmadmin start
        

## Upstream Data Feed for the LDM

The LDM operates on a push data model. You will have to find an institution who will agree to push you the data you are interested in. If you are part of the academic community please send a support email to `support-idd@unidata.ucar.edu` to discuss your LDM data requirements.

## Support

If you have a question or would like support for this EDEX Ingest Docker container, consider [submitting a GitHub issue](https://github.com/Unidata/edex-docker/issues). Alternatively, you may wish to start a discussion on the AWIPS Community mailing list: <awips2-users@unidata.ucar.edu>.
